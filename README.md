# univago
A Flask-Based API Providing Users with College Information

---

Run the univago API using Flask, and test it out using the sample webpage created for you. 

It is recommended you set up a virtual environment with the correct dependencies installed (listed in requirements.txt).

By default, the server uses a local PyMongo server - comment out lines requiring server in the API if not needed.
